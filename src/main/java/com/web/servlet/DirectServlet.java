/**
 * 
 * servlet lifecycle
 * 
 * 		init				called once
 * 		service				called everytime a request is processed
 * 		destroy				called once
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * REST
 * 		REpresentational State Transfer
 * 	six rest constraints
 * 		1. stateless
 * 			it does not keep track of the client and does not care
 * 				if it is the same or different client during 
 * 				subsequent requests.
 * 		2. client server separation
 * 			the client and the server are kept separate and the
 * 				updating of one does not mean the other has to.
 * 		3. layered system
 * 			the client is unaware of the different layers of the 
 * 				restful application.
 * 		4. code on demand (optional)
 * 			when making a request, we can get any type of format back 
 * 				in the response. RESTful applications can send back
 * 				any format including html, xml, javascript, java, css, etc...
 * 		5. cacheable
 * 			the information coming back from the restful application
 * 				should be cacheable.
 * 		6. uniform interface
 * 			we use the same endpoint with different http verbs to interact
 * 				with the same objects. This provides a uiform interface
 * 				to work with our api's.
